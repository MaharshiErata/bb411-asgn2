# BB411 Assignment Data Repository

This repository is dedicated to storing data related to assignments in the BB411 course at the Indian Institute of Technology Bombay (IITB).

## Overview

The primary purpose of this repository is to provide a centralized location for storing and managing gene-related data used in BB411 assignments. The data stored here includes gene sequences, localization signals, analysis scripts, and any other relevant files required for completing assignments.

## About BB411

BB411 is a course offered at IITB, focusing on topics related to bioinformatics, computational biology, and genomics. Assignments in this course often involve analyzing gene sequences, identifying localization signals, and conducting various computational biology tasks.

## How to Use

- **Cloning the Repository**: You can clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:
  ```
  git clone https://github.com/MaharshiErata/bb411-asgn2.git
  ```
  Replace `your-username` with your GitHub username.

- **Accessing Data**: Once cloned, you can access the gene-related data and other assignment files stored in this repository.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized as follows:
- `gens/`: Contains gene sequences in text format.
- `BB.ipynb`: Colab notebook with results, similar to script.py.
- `genes.txt`: Gene sequence I tested for localization sequence.
- `report.pdf`: Brief report on the assignment.
- `result.xlsx`: Results for presence of 'SKL' sequence in genes in the above folder.
- `README.md`: This README file providing an overview of the repository.
- `script.py/`: Python script for checking the presence of a particular localization sequence.
